# SecureNotes

A privacy-focused notes application built to practice client-side encryption, secure data handling, and clean frontend architecture using modern browser APIs.

This project focuses on encrypting user data in the browser, separating cryptographic logic from UI code, and building an offline-capable application without a backend.
